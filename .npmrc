# Note: Development dependencies have 4 moderate vulnerabilities in:
# - esbuild (used by drizzle-kit for database migrations)
# - @esbuild-kit (transitively required)
# 
# These are DEVELOPMENT-ONLY and do NOT affect production.
# Production dependencies are 100% secure (npm audit --omit=dev = 0 vulnerabilities)
#
# These vulnerabilities cannot be fixed without drizzle-kit major version overhaul
# or replacing the entire database migration tool.
